# livestock_monitoring
Indian agriculture is on the verge of adopting modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IOT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML). Currently, the availability of  AI in livestock is minimal since there are few players in the market that provide such services  to the farmers and livestock producers at a higher rate. Catering to nearly 267 millionfarmers  possess a huge opportunity in deploying AI used products at an affordable cost. One of the  affordable AI-based products is Wearable (Ear Tag) for livestock health monitoring. Commercializing the AI products in animal husbandry is not an easy task since farmers donâ€™t have awareness about how AI works and helps them in achieving the predictive results. Partnership between government, or with a private entity is a potential collaboration for implementing such technologies in animal husbandry. If implemented, the overall quality of livestock increases to a potential rate. The field of animal husbandry and also livestock will see  tremendous growth with a number of potential business opportunities
